# Configuration

To fully use HyperAFK you will need to configure the script. Below is an example config and below that is a table explaining what each option does.

```lua
Config = {}

Config.AFK_Time = 500 -- Time in seconds
Config.WarningMessageEnabled = true -- Enable warning messages
Config.NotifyScript = "ox_lb" -- Notification Script okokNotify, mythic_notify, pNotify
Config.WarningMessage = "You are about to be kicked for AFK" -- Warning message to be displayed before player is kicked.
Config.AFK_Kick_Message = "You have been kicked for being AFK." -- Kick message when baing AFK'd
Config.adminAce = "group.admin" -- The ace group to override the AFK timer
```
